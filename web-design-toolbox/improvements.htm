<h2>Page Loading Flicker</h2><div>

<p>When a page is loaded, the header and toolbar elements at the top do not exist at first, they are loaded after the inital page rendering. This leads to visual flicker. Additionally, the page content jumps down abruptly when the elements are inserted at the top.</p>

<p>Ideas for improvement:</p>

<p>First approach reserves space at the top of the document for header with a blue-colored border and some additional white padding for the toolbar. When the toolbar is loaded, the additioanl padding is reduced to normal size. When the header is loaded, the top border is removed.</p>

<p>Second approach: toolbar and header initially have zero height. After loading, they are expanded to full height with a smooth transition.</p>

<p>Third approach: New documents are loaded into the content container element. This effectively makes the website to a single-page application. Relative URLs must be adjusted according to the path of the new document.</p>
